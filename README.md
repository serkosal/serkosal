Mainly web-dev in TS and Python. But also system programming in c++. FOSS enthusiast. 

I love IT in general in wide variaty of aspects from general comp science to electronics, physics, math. But also I'm intersted in everything else: politics, biology, psychology.
I studied Physics in university. Self learned everything else.
I kinda know quantum mechanics :D.
I kinda don't get quantum mechanics.
